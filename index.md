# Uses
## Unaware 
* Records basic client information and activities/work delivered in order to operate at a basic level.
* Little or no benefits or rewards in relation to services.
* Collect and use data for requisite purposes e.g. basic financial management and legal/funder/contract compliance reporting.
* Continued funding may be seen as the only reason for collecting data
## Emerging
* Collect more data than required by legal/ funders/ contracts.
* Most data collection and analysis relates to capturing activities, measuring outputs, and basic financial analysis and forecasts.
* Rewards mostly around improved understanding of clients and ability to articulate the scale of activities delivered.
* Raising income and understanding fundraising performance likely to be key focus for additional data collection e.g. contracts, and sales, fundraising events, donors, grants.
* Able to feedback information to funders, partners and networks around specific projects/ services and the scale of activities. May struggle with multiple and or/repeat service use data.
* Starting to explore the difference between outputs and outcomes.
## Learning
* Collect data to be able to understand and evidence the types of clients/ needs and problems the organisation addresses. Uses both internal and reliable external data sources to do so.
* Starting to use data to understand different ways clients initially contact and engage with services over time (or not).
* Able to demonstrate activities being delivered for specific types of users across a range of projects and services.
* Capturing some outcomes data and learning to measure outcomes consistently. 
* Starting to capture feedback, monitoring and evaluation data on service/product quality and performance to inform improvements.
* Use data for income generation and some forecasting of sales and donations leading to more effective fundraising and commercial income.
* Starting to lead conversations with funders and partners using data.
* Building internal knowledge and expertise based on the analysis of data and dialogue on how to act on this.
* Strategic planning, particularly around efficiency and service development, is becoming more data informed.
## Developing
* All client, activity, output, and outcomes data is routinely collected.
* Services/products/campaigns are monitored to show performance on how, when and where these are used by whom.
* Services/products/campaigns are starting to be targeted at specific demographics and/or geographic locations in response to better understanding of needs/problems.
* Services/products/campaigns are regularly reviewed and adapted in response to data to optimise outcomes.
* Beginning to test assumptions on how the organisation has an impact and for whom.
* Starting to differentiate between approaches and understand what’s working and what’s not.
* Able to differentiate and explain attribution and contribution in evidencing and communicating impact.
* Exploring and learning how to measure long term impact.
* Data is starting to be used to inform efficiency savings (resources, processes and service/product design).
* Can coherently make the case to funders/investors/clients for existing and new services/products/campaigns.
* Learning and evaluation is embedded internally and informs both service and staff performance.
* Strategic planning and decision making is becoming considerably data informed.
## Mastering
* Data is used extensively, and in inter-related strategic ways, for a wide range of purposes.
* Sophisticated use of analysis delivers insights and predictions to influence service and organisational success.
* Evidencing and improving outcomes and impact is a primary focus. Experiments to identify differentiated impact and how to optimise this.
* Predict user needs and service/product options based on understanding client behaviours and how to influence these for the best outcomes.
* Design and delivery of services/products/campaigns is optimised at an individual/personal level.
* Services and interventions are highly targeted possibly in collaboration with other partners/service providers.
* The organisation is embedded in networks of knowledge and research in the context of its work. Partnerships and networks are strengthened through collaborative data sharing.
* Use data to increase efficiencies (resources, processes, services/product delivery).
* Robust evidence ensures credibility and is used to influence external policy and decision makers.
* Learn, evaluate and build knowledge - harness data for continuous improvement of products/services/ campaigns.
• Strategic planning and decision making is highly informed by data and based on past, present and future analyses.
